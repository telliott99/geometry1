In a parallelogram 
opposing sides are equal and parallel
opposing angles are equal

Def:  Pgram is a rectangle if
it has at least one right angle

-----

1. If Pgram has at least one right angle,
it has four right angles.

Let A be a right angle.  
Opposing angle C is a right angle.
Sides are parallel, hence
by alternate interior angles, B is a right angle
and so is D.

2. A = D.
So ABD cong DCA by SAS. 
Hence 2 diagonals equal,

2c. If 2 diagonals equal, 
ABD cong DCA by SSS.
